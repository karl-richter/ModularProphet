# ModularProphet

ModularProphet is a modular hybrid forecasting framework for interpretable time series forecasting. ModularProphet is re-designed and extendable version of NeuralProphet. The framework is built on PyTorch and combines Neural Network and traditional time-series algorithms, inspired by Facebook Prophet and AR-Net.

## About
This framework has been developed as part of the Master thesis "Interpretability Through Modularity: A Modular Framework for Hybrid Forecasting Model Creation" during a research stay at the Stanford Sustainable Systems Lab (S3L).
